Put here cartridge files:

  cartridge_black.bin
  cartridge_white.bin

and any trace files:
  trace_*.bin

Use ./decode_spi.sh <basename> [cartridge] for decoding trace file.

Use ./run_emu.sh <basename> [cartridge] for running trace file throught emulator.

Examples: 

"./decode_spi.sh training" - decodes file trace_training.bin 
into training.txt and training_data.txt using cartridge_black.bin
as cartridge image.

"./run_emu.sh training" - runs emulator with trace training.txt and writes log
into training.log using cartridge_black.bin as cartridge image.

"./run_emu.sh test cartridge_test.bin" - runs emulator with trace test.txt
using cartridge_test.bin as cartridge image.
