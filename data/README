Put here cartridge files:

  cartridge_black.bin
  cartridge_white.bin

and any trace files:
  trace_*.bin

Use ./decode_spi.sh <basename> for decoding trace file:

For example: "./decode_spi.sh training" decodes file trace_training.bin 
into training.txt and training_data.txt using cartridge_black.bin
as cartridge image.
